# Week 8 Lab 02 — Detect the Change

**Student Name:** N. Williams

**Date Completed:** September 9, 2026

**Module:** 3 — Practical Cryptography  
**Submission Path:** `week-08/labs/lab-02-detect-the-change.md`

> ## STOP — Protect secrets
> Never paste, upload, commit, or screenshot a password, passphrase, or private key. Do not run `cat` on any private-key file. Submit only the worksheet and the named screenshots. Keep all cryptographic files on the VM.

## How to Use This Lab

- **[TERMINAL]** means type or paste the command into the Cloud Heights terminal.
- **[WORKSHEET]** means type your response in this lab worksheet.
- Run commands in the order shown. Do not type the sample output.
- If your result does not match the stated success check, stop at the Troubleshooting box. Do not improvise with `sudo`, package installation, Azure settings, or SSH server configuration.

## Mission

Create a SHA-256 fingerprint of the original report, change a copy, and prove that the changed copy has a different fingerprint.

## What You Already Know

A cryptographic hash produces a fixed-length digest. Hashing does not hide content and has no decrypt step. A mismatch proves the two inputs differ; it does not identify who made the change.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
whoami
cf-week8-check
cd ~/cloud-heights/week8-cryptography
test -f evidence/incident-report.txt && echo "READY: starting file exists"
```

**Continue only if:** `whoami` prints `analyst`, all checks report `PASS`, and the final line is `READY: starting file exists`.

### If the VM Stops

Return to **My Lab Environment** in the Lab Portal and start your assigned VM. A stopped or deallocated VM is not deleted; saved disk files remain.

## Predict First

**[WORKSHEET]** If one line is added to a file, will its SHA-256 digest remain the same? Explain.

```text
The SHA-256 digest will not remain the same even if only one line is added to the file because the cryptographic hash function is designed so that even a minimal change to the input such as a single character or line produces a different, unpredictable output. This is an intentional property because it allows the hash to detect any modification to a file, no matter how small. 
```

## Guided Steps

### Step 1 — Hash the Original

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
sha256sum evidence/incident-report.txt | tee hashes/original.sha256
```

**Expected result:** A 64-character hexadecimal digest followed by the original filename.

### Step 2 — Create and Change a Copy

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
cp evidence/incident-report.txt hashes/incident-report-modified.txt
echo "Review Note: Integrity validation exercise completed." >> hashes/incident-report-modified.txt
tail -n 3 hashes/incident-report-modified.txt
```

**Expected result:** The added `Review Note` appears in the last three lines. The original file was not changed.

### Step 3 — Hash the Changed Copy

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
sha256sum hashes/incident-report-modified.txt | tee hashes/modified.sha256
```

### Step 4 — Compare the Digest Values

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
ORIGINAL_HASH=$(cut -d' ' -f1 hashes/original.sha256)
MODIFIED_HASH=$(cut -d' ' -f1 hashes/modified.sha256)
printf 'ORIGINAL: %s
MODIFIED: %s
' "$ORIGINAL_HASH" "$MODIFIED_HASH"
if [ "$ORIGINAL_HASH" = "$MODIFIED_HASH" ]; then
  echo "UNEXPECTED: hashes match — stop and troubleshoot"
else
  echo "EXPECTED: hashes differ because the file changed"
fi
```

**Required result:** Two different digest values and `EXPECTED: hashes differ because the file changed`.

**Evidence moment:** Capture the terminal now as `week08-lab02-sha256-comparison.png`.

## Stop & Check

If you see `UNEXPECTED`, do not submit.

### Troubleshooting

Run `tail -n 3 hashes/incident-report-modified.txt`. If the Review Note is missing, repeat Step 2 once, then repeat Steps 3–4. Do not edit the original file.

## Explain

**[WORKSHEET]** In 3–4 sentences, state what the mismatch proves and two things it does not prove.

```text
The mismatch in the SHA-256 digests proves that the content in the file was modified in some way because every altered character or added line produced a different hash. It does not prove exactly what in the file was changed because the hash itself gives no details about the content, location or nature of the modification. Lastly, it does not prove who made the change or when the change occurred because a hash mismatch only confirms that there is a difference between the two versions of the file and not any information about the circumstances surrounding the change.

Analysis Questions

What does the different SHA-256 value prove?

The different SHA-256 value proves that the content of the file has been modified in some way from its original state. No matter how small the change is, a single character or line modification for example, the hash output will be completely different. This is confirmation that integrity was broken and the file is no longer identical to the original version that the hash represented. It also serves as reliable evidence that a change has occurred, even without you knowing exactly what the change was.

Why does the mismatch not identify the person who changed the file?

The mismatch does not identify the person who changed the file because the hash mismatch only indicates that there is a difference in the file's content. It contains no information about who made the change, when it happened or how it was done. In order for the person responsible for making the change to be identified separate evidence such as system access logs, time stamps or audit records tied to a specific user account are required. The hash itself is a fingerprint of the content and not a record of activity or identity.

Why does hashing not protect confidentiality?

Hashing does not protect confidentiality because a hash is only a one way fingerprint that is used to verify integrity . It is not a way to hide or scramble the contents of the file. Anyone with access to the original file will be able to read it's contents in plain form, whether or not a hash has been generated for it. In order to protect confidentiality encryption is required because it transforms the readable data into unreadable data, which is a completely different function from hashing because hashing only detects if data has been changed.
