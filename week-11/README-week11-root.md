# CyberFoundations — Week 11 Labs

## Module 4: Security Fundamentals & IAM
## Week 11: IAM & Active Directory — Who Gets Access to What?

This file is the **overview for the whole `week-11` folder**. It sits directly inside `week-11/`. It is different from `week-11/labs/README-week11-submissions.md`, which is the step-by-step upload and submission guide inside the `labs` folder.

This week you work in the **Cloud Heights Identity Center**, a browser-based learning environment that **simulates** Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), Microsoft Entra ID and Azure resource access (RBAC). It is a safe practice copy — you are **not** administering real Microsoft systems, and nothing you do there affects any real organization.

## The Big Ideas (Explained Simply)

- **Person vs identity vs account:** a person is a human; an identity is how the system knows that person; an account is the login that identity uses. One person can have more than one account.
- **OU vs group vs role vs permission:** an **organizational unit (OU)** is a folder that organizes accounts; a **group** is a collection of accounts; a **role** is a named set of permissions; a **permission** is a single allowed action.
- **Authentication vs authorization:** authentication proves **who you are** (signing in); authorization decides **what you are allowed to do** after that.
- **Least privilege:** give each account only the access it needs to do its job — nothing more.
- **RBAC and ABAC:** role-based access control grants access by role; attribute-based access control grants access by attributes (like department or location).
- **AD DS vs Entra ID:** AD DS is the classic on-premises directory; Microsoft Entra ID is the cloud identity service. They solve similar problems in different places.
- **Joiner / Mover / Leaver:** the lifecycle of an account — created when someone joins, changed when they move roles, disabled when they leave.
- **Sign-in logs vs audit logs:** sign-in logs record authentication events; audit logs record what was changed or done.

## The Six Required Labs (In Order)

Complete all six labs in the **same persistent simulator state**. Do **not** reset between labs unless the mission instructions tell you to.

1. **Lab 01 — Identity Directory: Who Is Who?**
2. **Lab 02 — Authentication vs. Authorization**
3. **Lab 03 — Build and Manage the Directory**
4. **Lab 04 — Least Privilege Challenge**
5. **Lab 05 — Joiner, Mover, Leaver**
6. **Lab 06 — Identity Investigation + IAM Investigation Case File** — this produces your **Cloud Heights IAM Investigation Case File**, which is **Portfolio Deliverable 4**.

## Where Each Kind of Work Goes

| Place | What you do there |
|---|---|
| **Lab Portal** (this site) | Read this overview and the submissions guide. Complete your Week 11 Notes and Reflection here. Launch the simulator from **My Lab Environment**. |
| **Cloud Heights Identity Center** | Complete **all six labs**. Follow the **Current Mission** instructions, capture evidence, and use **Download This Lab** / **Download & GitHub** to get your Markdown reports. |
| **Your own GitHub portfolio repository** | Store your six lab reports in `week-11/labs/` and your supporting Week 11 files. |
| **Lab Submission Tracker** — https://labsubmission.cybervisionariesinstitute.org | Paste the GitHub **file URL** for each lab submission. |

**Downloading is not submission.** Downloading a report does not upload it to GitHub, and uploading to GitHub does not record it in the tracker. Each step is separate.

## Lab 06 and Week 12

Lab 06 produces the **Cloud Heights IAM Investigation Case File (Portfolio Deliverable 4)**. Keep it safe: in **Week 12** you will use it as the source material for your **Technical Incident Report + Executive Summary**. Lab 06 is the only Deliverable 4 submission — there is no seventh report.

## Good to Know

- The simulator is persistent: your changes carry from lab to lab. Do not reset between labs unless instructed.
- Capture evidence as you go — it is much harder to recreate later.
- The six lab reports are the graded Week 11 deliverables recorded in the tracker.
- This overview, the submissions guide, your notes and your reflection are supporting portfolio resources. They add no new deadlines, no extra assessment and no extra tracker entries.
- If something looks wrong in the simulator, re-read the **Current Mission** panel first, then ask your instructor.
