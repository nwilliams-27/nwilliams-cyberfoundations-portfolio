# Week 5 Lab 03 — Reading the Grid's Mail (Packet Inspector)

**Student Name:** Na'Ketta Williams

**Date Completed:** August 17, 2026

**Module:** 2 — Networking & Cloud Foundations | **Week:** 5  
**Submission Path:** `week-05/labs/lab-03-reading-the-grids-mail.md`

## Overview

Lesson 4 showed you the three panes of a packet analyzer — the packet list, the detail pane, and the filter bar — and told you that professionals live in this tool. This lab is where you stop watching and start driving. You'll open a recorded minute of traffic on The Grid and read it packet by packet: a name lookup (Part B), a handshake and the message that followed it (Part C), and one conversation that refuses to be read at all.

**The capture is the same for every student.** It's a recording, not a live network — fifteen packets, captured once, replayed identically for everyone. That means your numbers should match your classmates' exactly. If yours don't, you've filtered something out; clear the filter and look again.

**Nothing here can break anything.** You are reading a recording. There is no traffic to disturb and nothing to configure.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | CyberFoundations **Packet Inspector** — browser-based, inside the Lab Portal. Nothing to install. You will never install Wireshark for this course |
| Where to find it | Lab Portal main navigation, alongside the **CLI Simulator** |
| Capture | "The Grid — Workstation Capture." Canned and identical for every student |
| Prerequisite | Week 5, Lesson 3 (ports, the handshake) and Lesson 4 (the three panes) completed. Lab 01 recommended first — Part B builds directly on it |
| Filters available | `dns` · `icmp` · `tcp` · `http` · `ip.addr == x.x.x.x` · `tcp.port == N` |
| Time | Plan for 30–40 minutes, including this worksheet |

**Before you start:** log into the Lab Portal, open **Week 5 → Packet Inspector**, and load the capture named **"The Grid — Workstation Capture."** You should see a list of packets across the top, an empty detail pane below it, and a filter bar above everything. Keep this worksheet open in a second browser tab so you can record answers as you go.

**Get your screenshot tool ready now.** **Windows:** `Win + Shift + S` · **Mac:** `Cmd + Shift + 4`, then drag to capture. You'll need it twice in this lab, and both screenshots are required.

**A note on filters:** a filter never deletes packets. It hides the ones that don't match so you can concentrate. Clearing the filter box brings everything back. This matters in Part A — count *before* you filter anything.

---

## Part A — Orientation

### Step 1 — Count the Whole Capture

With the filter bar **empty**, look at the packet list and count how many packets the capture contains. Every packet has a number in the first column, so the last row tells you the answer without counting by hand.

The total number of packets in the capture:

```
15
```

### Step 2 — Inventory the Protocols

Scan the **Protocol** column from top to bottom and write down every distinct protocol name you see. There are five. You met all five in Lessons 2, 3 and 4 — this is the first time you're seeing them as labelled traffic rather than as ideas.

The protocols that appear in this capture:

```
DNS, ICMP, TCP TLS, HTTP
```

### Step 3 — Read the Columns

Four columns do most of the work in a packet analyzer. In your own words — not the Lesson 4 wording — write one plain sentence for each: what does it tell you, and what question does it answer?

What the Source column tells you:

```
Source tells me which device sent the packet and answers "who is talking?"

```

What the Destination column tells you:

```
Destination tell me what device the packet is headed to and answers "who is this for?"
```

What the Protocol column tells you:

```
Protocol tells me the type of communication (DNS, HTTP, TCP, etc.) and answers "what language or rules is are being used in this conversation?"
```

What the Info column tells you:

```
Info gives me a quick summary of what's happening in that specific packet and answers "what is this exchange about?"
```

### Step 4 — Spot Your Own Machine

One address appears more often than any other, and it's the one sending most of the requests. That's the workstation the capture was taken from — the same address you recorded in Lab 01.

The workstation's IP address, and how you worked out it was the workstation:

```
The workstation's IP address is 10.20.5.42. I identified it because it appears as the source or the destination in every packet across the capture. The other addresses appear in specific conversations, confirming that 10.20.5.42 is one constant machine or workstation that the capture was taken from.
```

---

## Part B — Follow a DNS Lookup

In Lab 01 you ran `dig foundry-archive.grid.local` and read a tidy answer: a name went in, an IP address came out. You saw the *result*. Now you're going to see the actual conversation that produced it — the question travelling across the wire and the answer coming back.

### Step 1 — Filter for DNS

Type `dns` into the filter bar and apply it. The packet list shrinks to the name-lookup traffic only.

The packet numbers that remain after the `dns` filter:

```
Packet numbers 1 and 2 remain after the DNS filter is applied.
```

### Step 2 — Read the Question

Click the first of your two DNS packets and read its Info column and detail pane. This is the query — your workstation asking the Directory Board a question.

The packet number of the query, and the name being asked about:

```
Packet number of the query: 1

The name being asked about: foundry-archive.grid.local
```

The source and destination addresses of the query — who asked, and who was asked:

```
Source address: 10.20.5.42 (ivy-workstation)

Destination address: 10.20.10.5 (the DNS server)
```

### Step 3 — Read the Answer

Now click the second DNS packet. This is the response coming back the other way.

The packet number of the response, and the IP address it returned:

```
Packet number of the response: 2

IP address it returned: 10.20.5.20
```

### Step 4 — Find the Door

DNS doesn't just travel to an address — it travels to a specific **port** on that address, the way Lesson 3 described a numbered door on a building. Open the detail pane on either DNS packet and find the port number the lookup used.

The port number DNS used here:

```
DNS packet 1 used port 53.
```

### Step 5 — Tie It Back to Lab 01

This is the same lookup you ran with `dig` in Lab 01 — same name, same answer, same DNS server. The difference is the altitude you're viewing it from. `dig` handed you the conclusion; the Packet Inspector shows you the two messages that produced it.

In two or three sentences: what did the packet view show you that `dig` did not?

```
The packet view showed query and the response as distinct packets each with their own timestamp and these are the two messages that produced the answer, dig shows a combined result with the same information. The packet view also showed the underlying mechanics that are not displayed by dig: the source and destination ports (54211 and 53), the UDP protocol that's carrying the traffic and the Ethernet level addresses of the machine. dig provided me with the conclusion of the lookup and the packet view provided me with the conversation that got me there.
```

### Step 6 — Capture Screenshot 1 (REQUIRED)

With the `dns` filter still applied and one of the two DNS packets selected, take a screenshot showing the filter bar, the filtered packet list, and the detail pane. Name it exactly **`packet-dns-query.png`**. Upload instructions are in the GitHub Commit section.

## Part C — Doors and the Handshake

Lesson 3 told the TCP handshake as a knock at a door: **SYN** ("knock"), **SYN-ACK** ("who's there — come in"), **ACK** ("thanks"). You're about to watch one happen.

### Step 1 — Filter for Port 443

Clear the `dns` filter and enter `tcp.port == 443` instead. Port 443 is HTTPS — one of the well-known doors from Lesson 3.

The packet numbers that remain after the `tcp.port == 443` filter:

```
Packet numbers 7, 8,9 and 10 remain after the tcp.port == 443 filter is applied.
```

### Step 2 — Identify the Three-Step Handshake

Three of those packets are the handshake itself. Find each one by reading the flags in the Info column, and record its number, its direction (which address sent it to which), and which step of the handshake it is.

The SYN — packet number and direction:

```
Packet 7
10.20.5.42 (from) -> 10.20.5.20 (to)
workstation to server
```

The SYN-ACK — packet number and direction:

```
Packet 8
10.20.5.20 (from) -> 10.20.5.42 (to)
server to workstation
```

The ACK — packet number and direction:

```
Packet 9
10.20.5.42 (from) -> 10.20.5.20 (to)
workstation to server
```

### Step 3 — Notice the Two Port Numbers

Look at the Info column on the SYN packet. Two port numbers appear: a high, odd-looking one on your workstation's side, and 443 on the server's side. Only one of them is a "well-known door" — the other is a temporary one your machine picked for this conversation.

The two port numbers, and which belongs to the server:

```
Port 443 belongs to the server.

Port 51514 is the temporary one that my machine picked for this conversation.

```

### Step 4 — Switch to the Plain Conversation

Clear the filter and enter `http` instead. This is a different conversation to a different machine on The Grid — the notice board — on port 80.

The packet numbers that remain after the `http` filter:

```
Packet numbers 14 and 15 remain after the http filter is applied.
```

### Step 5 — Open the Request and Read It

Click **packet 14** and expand its detail pane all the way. Unlike everything you've read so far, this packet's contents are ordinary text — you can simply read them, the way you'd read a note left on a desk.

The request line at the top of packet 14 (the method, the page, and the version):

```
GET /shift-notice.html HTTP/1.1

Request Method: GET
Request URI: /shift-notice.html
Request Version: HTTP/1.1
```

The Host line — which machine the request was addressed to:

```
Host: grid-notice.grid.local
```

Every other readable line in packet 14's detail pane:

```
User-Agent: GridBrowser/2.4
X-Staff-Code: FOUNDRY-2026-STOREROOM
```

### Step 6 — Notice What You Just Read

One of those lines is not like the others. It carries a value that looks like an internal code rather than a technical setting.

The name of that header and the exact value it carries:

```
X-Staff-Code: FOUNDRY-2026-STOREROOM

Header: X-Staff-Code
Value that it carries:FOUNDRY-2026-STOREROOM
```

In one or two sentences: if you were sitting on this network with a packet analyzer open, what would you now know that you were never meant to know?

```
I would know an internal access credential.
```

### Step 7 — Capture Screenshot 2 (REQUIRED)

With the `http` filter applied and **packet 14** selected and expanded so the readable lines are visible, take a screenshot. Name it exactly **`packet-http-plaintext.png`**.

### Step 8 — Now Try to Read the Other One

Clear the filter and click **packet 10** — the TLS Client Hello from the port 443 conversation you examined in Steps 1–3. Expand its detail pane and try to read it the same way you just read packet 14.

What packet 10's detail pane shows you, described in your own words:

```
The detail pane in packet 10 shows encrypted content. It is labeled as "Not readable in this capture." 
```

Compare it to packet 14 — what can you still tell about packet 10 from the packet list, even though you can't read its contents?

```
Even though I can't read the contents I can still tell who this conversation is between: the workstation, 10.20.5.42 and the server, 10.20.5.20, the ports that were used: 51514, 443, the protocol that was used: TLS and how much data was sent: 505 bytes. I can still see the metadata, I just can't see the actual message.
```

**Don't chase this yet.** You've just found something real, and the explanation is a later part of this course. For now, sit with the observation: two conversations, one legible and one not. Analysis Question 4 asks what you make of it.

## Analysis Questions

**Analysis Question 1.** In Part A you counted the packets before applying any filter. Explain why a filter is a *view* rather than a deletion, and describe a situation where forgetting that could lead an analyst to a wrong conclusion. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
A filter is a view and not a deletion because the filter only changes what's being displayed currently. All of the underlying packets are still in the capture, they are filtered out of view but not removed or deleted. If an analyst forgets that and only applies a filter looking for something specific, such as TCP traffic they might conclude that the DNS lookup did not occur because the DNS is hidden due to the filter. This can lead to a wrong conclusion such as there was no name resolution performed during the incident when the packets are still in the capture they're just filtered out on a temporary basis.
```

**Analysis Question 2.** You have now seen the same DNS lookup twice — once as `dig` output in Lab 01, once as two packets here. Describe what each view is good for, and name one investigation where you would specifically want the packet view. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
dig is good for quickly confirming what the DNS lookup returns, without any extra noise. The packet view is good for seeing the conversation as it is happening. You can see the exact timing, the ports and proves what machine sent and received the packets. I would want the packet view when I need to prove that a specific DNS query happened at a specific time and on a specific machine. 
```

**Analysis Question 3.** The handshake took three packets and about three milliseconds before a single byte of real content moved. Using the knock-at-the-door analogy from Lesson 3, explain what those three packets accomplish and why a connection would be less reliable without them. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
The SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK handshake allows both sides to confirm that they are able to hear each other before data is sent. Without the handshake, one side may send data before confirming that the other side is ready to receive it. That would make the connection less reliable because there is no agreement that both sides are ready before the data starts moving.
```

**Analysis Question 4.** You read packet 14 word for word, and packet 10 not at all — same capture, same network, same workstation. What do you think explains the difference between them? And why does it matter that the one you *could* read contained a staff code? You are not expected to know the mechanism yet; give us your best reasoning from what you observed. *(Minimum 4 sentences.)*

```
The difference i packets 10 and 14 is encryption. Packet 14 went over HTTP which is plain so the contents were readable. Packet 10 went over TLS/HTTPS so the contents could not be read because they were scrambled. Both packets came from the same workstation and the same network and this shows that the readability is dependent upon the protocol that was used and not the network. It matters that the content in packet 14 is readable because it contained a staff code that anyone who's capturing traffic here is able to read it in plain text, if it had gone over HTTPS like packet 10 the code would have been protected.
```
