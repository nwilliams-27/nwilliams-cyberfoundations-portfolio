# Week 4 Lab — File Permissions: The Badge Audit (CLI Simulator)

**Student Name:** Na'Ketta Williams

**Date Completed:** August 5, 2026

**Module:** 1 — Digital Infrastructure & CLI | **Week:** 4  
**Submission Path:** `week-04/labs/lab-01-file-permissions.md`

---

## Overview

Lesson 1 revealed what Ivy's badge rings mean: every file carries permissions — who may read, write, and execute it — and one wrongly-set ring can be a whole security incident. This lab has you run a small permissions audit of your own in the CLI Simulator: read the rings on a set of seeded files (Part A), fix three problems deliberately with `chmod` (Part B), and read the same story on the Windows side with `Get-Acl` (Part C). One screenshot from this lab becomes part of ★ Deliverable 1.

**Nothing here can break anything real.** The CLI Simulator is a consequence-free practice space — exactly the right place to change permissions for the first time.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | CyberFoundations CLI Simulator (browser-based, inside the Lab Portal) — no install, no VM, no real terminal required |
| Shell | Parts A and B use **bash**; Part C uses **PowerShell** |
| Prerequisite | Week 4, Lesson 1 completed |

**Before you start:** log into the Lab Portal, open **Week 4 → CLI Simulator**, and find the **"Foundry District Badge Office"** scenario. You'll see two entries in the list: **Badge Office — Bash** (used for Parts A and B) and **Badge Office — PowerShell** (used for Part C). Start with the Bash one. It seeds a small folder of files whose permissions have… issues. That's the point.

---

## Part A — Read the Rings

### Step 1 — Get the Security Report

Run the long listing (`ls -l`) in your starting folder. This is the same listing from Week 3's `ls`, with one flag added — and that flag turns it into a per-file security report.

Command you ran:

```
ls -l
```

Output (the full listing):

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    82 badge-codes.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    66 cleanup.sh
-rw-rw-rw- 1 morgan foundry   151 master-inventory.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    66 shift-notes.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    49 supply-list.txt
```

### Step 2 — Decode One File Completely

Pick any one file from your listing and decode its full permission string, audience by audience — owner, group, other — the way Lesson 1 decoded `-rwxr-xr--`. Write it as plain-English sentences ("the owner can…, the group can…, everyone else can…").

The file and its permission string:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    66 cleanup.sh

```

Your plain-English decode:

```
This is the 644 permission set. The owner can read and write the file. The group can only read the file. Everyone else can only read the file.
```

### Step 3 — Find the Problem File

One file in this folder is dramatically more permissive than it should be — every ring lit for every audience, or close to it. Find it. (Hint: scan the *other* triplet — the last three characters — down the whole listing. Which file gives strangers the most?)

The most permissive file and why you flagged it:

```
-rw-rw-rw- 1 morgan foundry   151 master-inventory.txt

I flagged this file because the group or other (everyone else on the system) should not be able to make changes or "write" to the file. 

```

---

## Part B — Change the Rings

This is your first time changing permissions, so we follow THE GATEKEEPER'S RULE on every single change: **check who can touch it now, change it, then check again.** That means `ls -l` before *and after* every `chmod`. The simulator's checklist will verify this — a change without both checks will not pass.

### Step 1 — Lock Down the Problem File

The problem file from Part A, Step 3 should not be writable by the group or by other. Fix it: revoke write from group (`g-w`), then revoke both read and write from other. Run `ls -l` before your first change and after your last one.

Commands you ran (in order, including both ls -l checks):

```
chmod g-w master-inventory.txt

ls -l

chmod o-rw master-inventory.txt

ls -l

```

The file's permission string BEFORE and AFTER:

```
-rw-rw-rw- 1 morgan foundry   151 master-inventory.txt

-rw-r--rw- 1 morgan foundry   151 master-inventory.txt

-rw-r----- 1 morgan foundry   151 master-inventory.txt
```

### Step 2 — Make a Script Runnable

The scenario seeds a script (its name ends in `.sh`) that its owner cannot currently execute. Grant the owner execute — and only the owner. Verify with `ls -l` after.

Commands you ran:

```
chmod u+x cleanup.sh
```

Output (the script's corrected permission string):

```
-rwxr--r-- 1 morgan foundry    66 cleanup.sh
```

### Step 3 — Protect the Secrets File

There's a file whose name makes clear it shouldn't be readable by everyone. Revoke other's read. Verify.

Commands you ran:

```
chmod o-r badge-codes.txt
```

Output (the corrected permission string):

```
-rw-r----- 1 morgan foundry    82 badge-codes.txt
```

### Step 4 — Capture Your Audit Evidence (REQUIRED screenshot)

**Read this first — it will save you some confusion.** Every challenge in the CLI Simulator hands you a **fresh copy** of the Badge Office folder. That's deliberate: each challenge is its own clean exercise. You'll see `(fresh filesystem for this challenge)` on the divider line each time. It also means your fixes from earlier challenges will *not* still be showing when you reach the last one. Nothing you did was undone, and nothing you did was wrong — the folder was simply reset.

So build your evidence listing **inside the last challenge**. Apply all three fixes there, one after another, then run one final `ls -l`:

```
chmod g-w master-inventory.txt
chmod o-rw master-inventory.txt
chmod u+x cleanup.sh
chmod o-r badge-codes.txt
ls -l
```

That one listing shows all three fixes together — that's your evidence. Take a screenshot of your simulator session showing it. **This screenshot is required — it is part of ★ Deliverable 1.** Name it `cli-permissions-audit.png`. You'll upload and embed it in the GitHub Commit section below.

## Part C — The Same Story, Windows Edition

### Step 1 — Read One File's Guest List

Switch to the PowerShell side of the scenario and run `Get-Acl` on the seeded file the scenario panel points you to. Windows shows a *list* of named accounts and rights instead of three ring-triplets.

Command you ran:

```
Get-Acl shift-notes.txt
```

Output (the owner line and at least one access entry):

```
Path : shift-notes.txt
Owner : morgan
Access : -rw-r--r--
```

### Step 2 — Translate One Entry

Take one access entry from your output and translate it into plain English, the same way you decoded the Linux string in Part A.

Your plain-English translation:

```
This is the 644 permission set. The owner can read and write the file. The group can only read the file. Everyone else can only read the file.
```

## Analysis Questions

**Analysis Question 1.** In Part A you found the problem file by scanning the *other* triplet. Why is the "other" audience usually the most important one to audit first on a shared system? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
The "other" audience is usually the most important one to audit first on a shared system because it represents everyone else on the system; everyone other than the owner and defined team (group). The other audience should not be able to make any changes (write) to the file, they should only be able to read the file.
```

**Analysis Question 2.** THE GATEKEEPER'S RULE requires a check before *and* after every change, even though `chmod` rarely fails. What does the *before* check protect you from, and what does the *after* check protect you from? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
The ls -l check before making any changes protects me from making a change that I can't verify or a change that can't be undone. The ls -l check after making changes catches wrong moves before a second or third move causes confusion. 
```

**Analysis Question 3.** Lesson 1 called least privilege "granting what's needed and revoking the rest." Pick one of your three fixes from Part B and explain it in least-privilege terms: what was granted that wasn't needed, and who could have taken advantage? *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
Before my change, the permissions on the master-inventory.txt were rw-rw-rw, which meant everyone on the system could read and write (modify) the file, even if their role was not related to the file. Any user on the system could have taken advantage. Group did not need write permissions and others did not need read or write permissions. After my fix, others had no access to the file at all; leaving the owner (read/write) and the group (read only) with the ability to interact with the file.
```

**Analysis Question 4.** Windows ACLs can name specific people; Linux permissions use three fixed audiences. Describe one situation where the Windows approach would be genuinely more useful — and one cost of that extra flexibility. *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
Windows ACLs can be useful when different people need different access levels to the same file. For example, if I were managing a project I would need full access to the file, my team would need read only access and others would not need access at all. I would be able to name each person on my team (group) individually instead of putting them all in one bucket. This flexibility makes it more complex to quickly review who has access and it makes it easier to accidently give someone permissions that they should not have.
